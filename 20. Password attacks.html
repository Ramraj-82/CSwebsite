</ul>
<h3 id="common-types-of-password-attacks">Common Types of Password Attacks</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Brute Force Attack:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is guessed.</li>
<li>Also called <em><strong>trail and error method</strong></em></li>
<li>While time-consuming for complex passwords, it can be effective against weaker ones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dictionary Attack:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A dictionary attack uses a list of common words, phrases, or names to guess passwords.</li>
<li>Attackers often combine words from dictionaries or use personal information to create more targeted guesses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spraying Attack:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This involves using a single password to try logging into multiple accounts with different usernames.</li>
<li>If the same password is used across multiple platforms, it can be a successful strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credential Stuffing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attackers use leaked credentials from previous data breaches to try logging into different accounts.</li>
<li>This is especially effective if users reuse passwords across multiple services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phishing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This involves tricking users into revealing their passwords through deceptive emails, messages, or websites.</li>
<li>Phishing attacks often use social engineering techniques to manipulate victims.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keylogging:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This involves capturing keystrokes as they are typed, including passwords.</li>
<li>Keyloggers can be installed on a victim’s device through malware or physical means.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shoulder Surfing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observing someone entering their username and password by looking over the user shoulder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-to-protect-against-password-attacks">How to Protect Against Password Attacks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information like names, birthdays, or pet names.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Require additional verification steps, such as a code sent to your phone or a biometric scan, to access accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Password Managers:</strong> Use a secure password manager to store and generate strong, unique passwords for each account and update the password regularly every 30 /45 days.</li>
<li><strong>Account Lockout:</strong> Implement account lockout &amp; authentication policies.</li>
<li><strong>Enable notifications:</strong> Enable notifications and alerts for login failures, password change and other security related activities.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> Keep your software and operating systems up-to-date with the latest security patches.</li>
