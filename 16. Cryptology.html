<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Cryptology</strong></em> is the study of codes and ciphers. It involves the creation of secret messages <strong>(encryption)</strong> and the breaking of these messages <strong>(decryption)</strong>. In simpler terms, it’s the science of secret writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cryptology combines two main areas such as  **Cryptography ** and **Cryptanalysis **</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, cryptology is all about ensuring that <em><strong>messages and data stay private and secure</strong></em> from unauthorized access.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-cryptography">What is Cryptography?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>“Cryptography”</strong></em> is the whole of the techniques used to transform the transmitted information into a form that cannot be understood by unauthorized people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Cryptography</strong></em> includes mathematical methods that try to provide the basic objectives of information security such as <em><strong>confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>“Cryptography”</strong></em> is the science that converts plaintext to ciphertext with the crypto algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cryptography</strong> is the <em>broader field</em> that encompasses all the techniques and methods used to secure communication and data. This includes encryption, but also other concepts like digital signatures, hashing, and steganography.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Cryptography is the toolbox, and encryption is one of the tools within it. <em><strong>So, cryptography and encryption both are not the same.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="what-is-cryptanalysis">What is Cryptanalysis?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cryptanalysis</strong> is the process of <em>breaking</em> a cryptographic system or algorithm. It’s an attempt to decipher a message without having the correct key.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : Decryption is the intended way to open a locked box using the correct key. Cryptanalysis is trying to open the box without the key, perhaps by finding a hidden lock or picking the lock. <em><strong>So, cryptanalysis and decryption both are not the same.</strong></em></p>
