<ul>
<li>A protocol in a network is <strong>a set of rules and guidelines</strong>, which defines how the data is transmitted and received between two (or) more connected devices over a network for a specific purpose.</li>
<li>It ensures that devices and systems can communicate with each other effectively and accurately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some key aspects of protocols:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data Format</strong>: Specifies how data is structured and formatted for transmission.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Defines how errors are detected and corrected.</li>
<li><strong>Flow Control</strong>: Manages the pace at which data is sent to ensure that the receiver can handle it.</li>
<li><strong>Session Management</strong>: Controls the establishment, maintenance, and termination of connections between devices.</li>
<li><strong>Addressing</strong>: Provides a way to identify devices on a network.</li>
</ol>
