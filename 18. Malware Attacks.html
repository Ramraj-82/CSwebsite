<ul>
<li><strong>Malware</strong> , short for <em><strong>"malicious software,"</strong></em> is any software designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise a computer system, network, or device. It encompasses a wide range of malicious programs and threats, each with specific objectives and methods of attack.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="here-are-some-common-types-of-malware">Here are some common types of malware:</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Viruses</strong>: Malicious code that attaches itself to legitimate programs or files and spreads when these programs are executed or files are shared. Viruses can corrupt or delete data and affect system performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you download the malicious file from the websites, it infect the system after you open or execute it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Worms</strong>: It is a malicious software, that can infect and replicate the itself and spread to other systems in the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojans</strong>: It also called as trojan horse, it disguise itself as a legitimate software to tricking the user to install it.<br>
EX: Getting popup like you anti virus software license going to expire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ransomware</strong>: Encrypts a victim’s files or locks them out of their system, demanding a ransom payment for restoration. Ransomware attacks can be highly disruptive and costly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spyware</strong>: Secretly monitors and collects information about a user’s activities, such as browsing habits, keystrokes, or personal data, often without the user’s consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adware</strong>: Displays unwanted advertisements, often in the form of pop-ups or banners. While less harmful than other types of malware, adware can be intrusive and may track user behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rootkits</strong>: Designed to gain unauthorized root or administrative access to a system while hiding their presence. Rootkits can be used to maintain access and avoid detection while performing malicious activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyloggers</strong>: Records keystrokes made by a user, potentially capturing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bots and Botnets</strong>: Malware that turns a compromised computer into a “bot,” which can be controlled remotely by an attacker. Botnets are networks of infected machines used to perform coordinated attacks, such as DDoS attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fileless Malware</strong>: Operates in memory rather than relying on files stored on disk, making it harder to detect using traditional antivirus methods. It often exploits system tools and legitimate processes to execute its payload.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-malware-can-harm-your-system">How Malware Can Harm Your System:</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data theft:</strong> Malware can steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data.</li>
<li><strong>System damage:</strong> Malware can corrupt files, damage hardware, or render a system inoperable.</li>
<li><strong>Network disruption:</strong> Malware can spread through a network, infecting multiple computers and disrupting operations.</li>
<li><strong>Financial loss:</strong> Malware can lead to financial losses due to data breaches, system downtime, and legal expenses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-protect-against-malware">How to Protect Against Malware:</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software</strong>: Install and regularly update security software to detect and remove malware.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Software Updated</strong>: Regularly update operating systems, applications, and firmware to patch vulnerabilities that malware might exploit.</li>
<li><strong>Be Cautious with Email and Downloads</strong>: Avoid opening suspicious email attachments or downloading software from untrusted sources.</li>
<li><strong>Enable Firewalls</strong>: Use firewalls to block unauthorized access and monitor network traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Backup Data Regularly</strong>: Regularly back up important files to protect against data loss from malware attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-mitigate-malware-infection">How to Mitigate Malware Infection:</h3>
<hr>
<p>If your machine is infected with malware, it’s crucial to act quickly to minimize damage and restore security. Here are the steps to follow:</p>
<h3 id="disconnect-from-the-internet">1. <strong>Disconnect from the Internet</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immediate Action</strong>: Disconnect the infected machine from the internet to prevent the malware from spreading further or sending out sensitive data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asses-the-situation">2. <strong>Asses the situation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify the source machine details like hostname, IP address and location</li>
<li>Identify the process name, source path and target path of the malware</li>
<li>Identify the action of the EDR, like deleted, quarantined, Not able to deleted etc…</li>
<li>Identify the malware type and check history of the malware</li>
<li>Scope of the malware</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="backup-important-data">3. <strong>Backup Important data</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Only backup the critical files, not executables using offline backup or USB drives.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="install-the-os">4. Install the OS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clean or Reimage the system and update the OS and apply patches available till now.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="remove-the-malware">5. <strong>Remove the Malware</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Install Anti-Virus with latest .DAT file, anti-malware tool and perform full scan to remove the malware from the systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="restore-from-backup">6. <strong>Restore from Backup</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Backup data also should scan before restoring to the system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monitor-your-system">7. <strong>Monitor Your System</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>After removing the malware, monitor the system for any signs of unusual behavior or unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="back-to-the-network">8. Back to the network</h3>
<ul>
<li>If every thing is clean, the system back to the network and then re install required applications for business requirement.</li>
