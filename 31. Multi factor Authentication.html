<ul>
<li><strong>MFA</strong> stands for <strong>Multi-Factor Authentication</strong>, which is a security mechanism that requires users to provide multiple forms of verification before they can access a system, service, or application.</li>
<li>The goal of MFA is to add an <strong>extra layer of security by combining two or more authentication factors</strong>, making it much harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access, even if they know the user’s password.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of MFA:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What You Know (Knowledge Based):</strong> This is a classic MFA method relies on info that only the user should know like username and password, PIN no, security questions like “what city you born” etc.</li>
<li><strong>What you have(Possession based):</strong> This method requires users physically possess a specific item to authentic like a security token from authenticator app and  phone OTP Via SMS.</li>
<li><strong>What you are(Inherence-Based)</strong> This method requires users fingerprint and facial recognition.</li>
<li><strong>What you do (Pattern-Based):</strong> This method focusing on analyzing the user unique behavior patterns like speed of their typing on keyboard, the way move mouse etc.</li>
<li>Location and time based MFA.</li>
</ol>
