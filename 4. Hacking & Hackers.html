<p><strong>Hacking</strong>: Hacking is the process of identifying vulnerabilities/loopholes/flaws/weakness and exploit (take advantage of) those to gain an unauthorized access to the system or network.</p>
<p><strong>Hacker Types</strong>: Hackers can be categorized based on their motives and intentions. Here are some common types:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>White Hat Hackers:</strong> These are ethical hackers who use their skills to identify and fix vulnerabilities in systems. They work with organizations to improve security and prevent malicious attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Black Hat Hackers:</strong> These are malicious hackers who exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain or to cause harm. They may engage in activities like stealing data, disrupting services, or launching attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gray Hat Hackers:</strong> These hackers operate in a gray area between white hat and black hat. They may exploit vulnerabilities but often do so with good intentions, such as exposing security flaws to force organizations to address them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Script Kiddies:</strong> These are individuals who use pre-written tools and scripts to carry out attacks, often without understanding the underlying techniques. They are typically less skilled than other hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hacktivists:</strong> These are hackers who use their skills for political or social causes. They may launch attacks to protest government policies or corporate practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>State-Sponsored Hackers:</strong> These are hackers employed by governments to conduct cyberattacks against other countries or organizations. They often have advanced skills and resources.</p>
