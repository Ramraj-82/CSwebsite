<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software like viruses, worms, and ransomware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Manipulating people to gain unauthorized access or information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Password Attacks:</strong> A password attack is any attempt to exploit a vulnerability in user authorization within a digital system. These attacks aim to gain unauthorized access to accounts, networks, or systems by cracking or guessing passwords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) &amp; DDoS Attacks:</strong> Overwhelming a network or system with traffic to disrupt its services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Man-in-the middle attack:</strong> Intercepts communication between two parties, potentially altering or stealing data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications to execute malicious code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong>: This attack injects malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users. It can be used to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credential Stuffing</strong>: This attack involves using stolen usernames and passwords from one data breach to gain unauthorized access to accounts on other websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credential Sniffing</strong>: Credential sniffing is a type of cyber attack where attackers intercept and capture login credentials, such as usernames and passwords, as they are transmitted over a network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spoofing Attacks:</strong> Spoofing attacks involve tricking a system or user into believing that a malicious entity is a trusted or legitimate one. Mail aim of this attack is attacker hide his own identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insider Threats</strong>: These attacks come from within an organization, where employees or other insiders misuse their access to steal data, cause disruptions, or commit fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drive-By Downloads</strong>: Malicious software is automatically downloaded and installed on a device when a user visits a compromised or malicious website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zero-Day Exploits</strong>: These attacks take advantage of vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to the vendor and for which no patches or fixes exist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="impact-of-cyberattacks">Impact of Cyberattacks:</h3>
<hr>
