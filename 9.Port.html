<ul>
<li>Port is <strong>software defined number</strong> which is associated with specific protocol that is used for communication between 2 devices in the network for specific service/process.</li>
<li>These ports are not visible and can not touch manually.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Ports help manage multiple network services and applications on a single device by distinguishing between different types of network traffic.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-ports">Types of ports:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ports are identified by port numbers, which are 16-bit integers ranging from <strong>0 to 65,535</strong> into 3 categories.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Well-Known Ports</strong>: Ranges from 0 to 1,023. These ports are assigned and controlled by the ** ** (IANA) and are used by widely used protocols and services. For example:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Port 80</strong>: HTTP (web traffic)</li>
<li><strong>Port 443</strong>: HTTPS (secure web traffic)</li>
<li><strong>Port 25</strong>: SMTP (email sending)</li>
<li><strong>Port 22</strong>: SSH (secure shell)</li>
</ul>
<p>2.<strong>Registered Ports</strong>: Ranges from 1,024 to 49,151. These ports are used by <strong>software applications</strong> that are not as universally recognized as those using well-known ports. They can be registered with IANA for <strong>specific applications or services.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Dynamic or Private Ports</strong>: Ranges from 49,152 to 65,535. These ports are typically used for ephemeral or <strong>temporary purposes</strong> and are often assigned dynamically by the operating system for client-side applications to use during communication sessions.</li>
</ol>
