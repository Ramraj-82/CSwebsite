<ul>
<li><strong>ICMP</strong>, or <strong>Internet Control Message Protocol</strong>, is a core protocol within the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. It is primarily used for <em><strong>error reporting and diagnostic (troubleshooting) purposes</strong></em>, helping to manage and control network communication.</li>
<li>It is a <em><strong>connectionless protocol</strong></em> that allows devices to communicate without opening a connection with each other. ICMP is different from Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in that it’s not associated with a transport layer protocol.</li>
<li>It is <strong>network layer protocol.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-icmp-messages">Common ICMP Messages:</h3>
<p><strong>1. Echo Request and Echo Reply (Ping):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Echo Request:</strong> Sent by a device to another device to check if it is reachable.</li>
<li><strong>Echo Reply:</strong> Sent by the destination device in response to the Echo Request, confirming its presence and connectivity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Traceroute:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ICMP can be used to determine if a destination is unreachable. For example, if a device replies with a type 3 destination unreachable message, it could mean that the remote host or network is unreachable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.Time Exceeded:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sent when a packet’s time-to-live (TTL) value expires, indicating that the packet has been discarded because it took too long to reach its destination. This is commonly used in <code>traceroute</code> to identify the route packets take.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4.Redirect:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Used by routers to inform hosts that a better route to the destination exists, encouraging the host to use the alternative route.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5.Source Quench:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An indication that a sender should slow down the rate of packet transmission because the receiver is overloaded (note: this message is now considered deprecated and is rarely used).</li>
</ul>
