<p><em><strong>Encryption</strong></em> is the process of converting <strong>plaintext into ciphertext</strong> is called “Encryption”. There is an algorithm used mathematically in the encryption process.</p>
<p><em><strong>Decryption</strong></em> is the process of converting <strong>ciphertext into plaintext</strong> is called decryption. As in the encryption process, an algorithm is used in this process.</p>
<p><em><strong>Key</strong></em> is a value given as input to encryption and decryption algorithms. Using this value, the encryption and decryption process is applied.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Plaintext”</strong></em> is a readable and understandable text or piece of text (unencrypted data).</p>
<p><em><strong>“Ciphertext”</strong></em> is the value produced as a result of the algorithm after the plaintext is given as an input to a crypto algorithm. It means encrypted data.</p>
