<p><strong>1. Credential Cracking</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Credential cracking involves attempting to guess or compute passwords through methods like brute force, dictionary attacks, or rainbow tables.</li>
<li><strong>How It Works</strong>: Attackers systematically try many combinations of usernames and passwords until they find the correct one. This can be done using automated tools that test multiple combinations rapidly.</li>
<li><strong>Prevention</strong>: Implement account lockout policies, use strong password policies, and employ CAPTCHA systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Credential Sniffing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Credential sniffing involves intercepting or capturing user credentials as they are transmitted over a network. This often happens when data is not encrypted or when there are vulnerabilities in network protocols.</li>
<li><strong>How It Works</strong>: Attackers use various tools to capture login credentials from network traffic. For example, if a user logs into a website over an unencrypted connection, an attacker can use a network sniffer to capture their username and password.</li>
<li><strong>Prevention</strong>: Use encrypted connections (HTTPS), secure Wi-Fi networks, and strong network security protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Credential Stuffing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Credential stuffing is a type of attack where attackers use lists of stolen username-password pairs to gain unauthorized access to accounts on various websites or services.</li>
<li><strong>How It Works</strong>: Attackers take advantage of the fact that many users reuse passwords across different sites. They automate login attempts using these stolen credentials in hopes of gaining access to accounts where the same credentials have been reused.</li>
<li><strong>Prevention</strong>: Use unique, strong passwords for each account, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), and employ rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms on login pages.</li>
</ul>
